## Implement Sessions
Using Redis and JWT
So users don't have to sign in and out again.

One of most used and loved DB
redis is NoSQL db. In-Memory DB. NoSQL mongodb or couchdb. Documents like linked in profiles, document like data. Wide Columna and graph db, social media app db.
Redis is like javascript, key-value. (in memory db) Used for short-lived data, webpage hitcounts. Not large data-sets. Small pieces of data so it can be in machines memory.

And you don't care if you might lose data. Redis does take snapshots and save to disk. Use Redis with small piece of data we can come back to snapshot

Big companies have different tools and diffrent DB to work with what we have.
