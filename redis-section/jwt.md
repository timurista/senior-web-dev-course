## JWT
Cookies that github has assigned to me.

`jwt.io`

encodes data but can be easily decoded via website so you wouldn't want to store sensitive info here.

## Express server jwt
a middleware that requires user to have to provide authentication when registering. Good tool for future projects. Want to make sure can run backend.
