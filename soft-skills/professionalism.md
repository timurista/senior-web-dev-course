## Professionalism
1) do you make it easy to get hold of you.

Have a voicemail
You have to be flexible because every communication tool other people want to. You have to communicate on their terms.

Come across as someone who people want to work with. Get a business card, if you are a networking event. It shows you are serious and professional.

## Business Page?
Upgrades professional image. Linkedin or new business page for people to reach you.

## Dress to Impress?
It works for you in your industry clean and hygenic. At startups leave suite and tie at home. Styles do change, these days beards on men seem professional. Tatooes in general are not great. Has to be consistent with what you are about. Don't do anything that confuses people, wear something that doesn't confuse people.

## Have a rational
why is your hairstyle or clothing in a certain way. Does your breath stink.
Does your body have odor? If you are in industry make sure your BO is acceptable. Get someone who will tell you straight to your face. Anything about you that smells bad?
