## Smart Brain App
adding more features like in real life. User Profiles, sessions for management, and more

set up env

## Good strategy for analyzing
look at package.json to get a sense of what project is doing. Look at the controllers to try and figure out how the encryption is happening. And a sense of what app does.

## FE project
see app they are using, entry point as app. And what the main component has. Look at initial state. Which lives in component.

First thing programmers do is they come and criticize and try to clean it up. Yes things to improve, but you need to know decision was made to make this thing. Constructive criticism is good. But you don't know what devs at time were doing. Have some humility, seeing where you could change in future. Goal is to work with team to make project better.

## Humility
look at code nuetrally without criticism. Will make it easier to work with your team.

## Big Picture Focus
When you get a feature request, always look at larger structure of the app. Get an idea of what it is doing, then start narrowing down things and looking at smaller details. Until you get that feature you might want to improve.

### Tips
Also use console.log  to experiment and understand how the entire system works.
