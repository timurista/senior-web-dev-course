you spend less money to set everything up, and less time deploying app. Ready out of gate for performance and scale. Infrastructure partially in cloud. Let big companies handle scale, and cloud handles infra needs. 

## Why do we need aws?

## AWS services
No shortage of aws services. Most common services. But there are a bunch of them. EC2 basic server you can run. Like digital ocean linux serve.

## EC2

## Lambda
