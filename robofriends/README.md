This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project uses create react app and tachyons for easy css styling.

## Error Boundaries

flow back up errors

## React Router notes

react is only a view layer so it only enables you to build components. It has local state management and event handling, but it helps with the view. Large scale apps need new features added on. For example, react-router is common to see out there for changing pages in url. Standard for react-redux project, to use.

Utility libraries
  - Rambda (functional ideology)
  - lodash

# Styling
  - glamorous
  - styled components
  - css modules

## Gatsby js
  - static webpages in react
  - simple text based pages that work well
  - nextjs

Alos you can use material-ui
reselect, improve performance of apps
redux-saga, it's super-charged thunk

## immutable js
- enforce that among dev teams

if you add, ask yourself DO I need this? justify it which improves value of the product. Think of dev teams, will they benefit from this? Is frustration worth it...

## What and why bundler?
Need something to minify and maintain the javascript files into one. They can optimize images, and maximize delivery of images for the file. Webpack was doing stuff under the hood. Still want to know how things work under the hood.
THe big three right now are parcel, webpack, and rollup.js

rollupjs is good with tree shaking, throwing out code you don't need.

zero config for parcel, a bit easier to get setup.

- webpack most likely setup for big projects
- parcel is small project just need to get up and going.
- rollup is more own npm module

but things change so rapidly. When you have an issue, know what it does so you can read through doc config and read through it.

> time is better spent write better tests, don't spend too much time learning how to do configuration.
