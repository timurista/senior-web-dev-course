## Containers
Composed of multiple layers, services each doing its own thing. They are communicating with each other to do a simple thing. Keep everything small, simple input -> output. Break into small pieces.

lets us create containers around services.

## History Lesson
before docker we had virtualized machines, sandboxed env. Full-fledged computer. Vm was like another computer ontop of it. Pretty big, but consistent matter. Sometimes took a few minutes to spin it up. Docker wraps everything up in complete container to run.

lightweight alternative to full VM, just to run single app on each container. Microservices, use host OS just few seconds and you are up and running.

docker bundles your app into standalone executable image and then docker executes this image inside this container which is isolated from host machine.

Docker hub is like npm, store-like website to download and use. Node image to use. 

small services to duplicate so we can grow with it.
