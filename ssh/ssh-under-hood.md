## Symmetrical Encryption

jumble text, a way to have secrets.
Key is same between me and my friend.
"Hello" ==> "EI320" ==> "Hello"
Anyone with key can decrypt message

### Key exchange algorithm
  no bad actors intercepting it
  key is never transmitted
  instead they share public data
    to calculate the key




## Asymmetrical Encryption
unlike symmetricl encryption, 2 diff keys for encryption and decryption. These 2 keys

public

and

private keys

public-private key pair

message encrypted by public key can only be decrypted by same machines private key

private key is never removed, it is always there.

SSH only uses this during key exchange algorithm

before initiate a secure connection both parties generate this and share respective keys.

## Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

each party to combine private with the public data to create a unique key.
