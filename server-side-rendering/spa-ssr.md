## Server Side Rebder vs SPA
first webpage conventional method was using server side rendering, render it and send to client. Then client gets that info and shows it.
Very little interactivity back then.

SPA producthunt, etc. is done inside app. Page doesn't refresh just parts of page refresh you need. Websites are more like apps.

## SPA
good SEO on single page app is harder. Client side rendering SPA and server side rendered.
