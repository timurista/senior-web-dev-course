## Open Closed Principle

We assume existing function is already unit tested. Design and writing of code should be written in a way so we modify existing code as rarely as possible.

OC Principle
Open for extension, closed for extension. Most painful part of software engineering is 

## Common Interface
Implement a thing once then we can reuse it.

1. strategy pattern
2. template pattern also

## Design patterns
with those 2 patterns we keep as much code unchanged as possible.
