## Artificial nueral networks

ANN
the nueron, activation function
how do nueral networks work

## NN learn?
Gradient Descent vs brute force
stochastic gradient descent
backpropagation

## The Nueron
Basic building block

[ dendrites ] large tail at end of the nueron (shorthead)
nueron is the cell large area in center.
Axon is connecting the nueron to the axion tunnel.
Nuerons is pretty much useless, but with many they work together. Dendrites receive signal. Axon is transceiver. Dendrites don't touch other nuerons. We just call them synapses

## Nuerons in Machines
nueron / node
gets inputs and produces output signal.
input value x1, etc.
[ input layer ] yellow
electrical impulses from outside world and it makes sense of world through your senses.

passed via synapses to nuerons.
it's a row all independent variables in model.

Mean of zero, variance of 1.
normalize them, min - max and get values between 0 and 1.
Everything to be about same values.

## Output value
can be continuous (price)
categorical (several, enum)
single observation.

like linear regression, put in values you deal with one row. All values in that one row.

## Synapses with weights
weights are cruical to how they function. NN adjust weights and decides which signals are more important than others.

What happens inside the nueron?
It takes weighted sum
Sum [weight * input(x)]. Then it applies activation function and might pass the signal on or not pass it on.
