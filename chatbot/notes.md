## Classical vs Deep learning MOdel

4 types
1. if/else rules simple chatbot
2. Audio frequency (Speech recognition)
3. CNN for text recognition (classification)
4. Seq2Seq many apps

## End to End deep learning model
NLP on right, seq2seq in middle
did we get message across
did they apply a model to get a valid solution

## Happening now?
Robot voice, they say please tell what you are calling about?

## What is happening now?
THey use deep learning algorithm to analyze your sound forms with vocal coords. And it takes that info and it transcribes your voice into words. But again it doesn't work.

2 separate deep learning models or perhaps 5 steps of deep learning. But if you separate them the training is discrete and is not connected.

## Deep learning -- removes discrete separations
One brain is taking care of the whole thing
End-to-end deep learning models. Vague and not well defined, way of saying it's build from start to finish.
