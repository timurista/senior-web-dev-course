## Rebalancing trees (best for lookups)

AVL

redblack trees

INsert 77 into tree, but now add 80

## Red black tree (best for inserts)

We insert and see it is unbalanced. They rotate until it is balanced.

## Binary Heap

max heap is collection of data.
Every node on top has better value.

Binary heaps are good for comparative lookups.

Say I want people with scores > 30.

## Heaps used

data storage, priority queues

inserts can take o log(n) in binary heap worst case.

## Priority queue

Heap data structure not same as memory heap.
