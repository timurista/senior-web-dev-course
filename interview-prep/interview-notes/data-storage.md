## Storage

### CPU

fast access, volatile.
Asks RAM what is shelf number 0. It means we can get 0 and immediately access 1071 shelf. Access memory really fast to any shelf at once. Any address at memory. Closer is to computer, faster it runs. CPU tiny memory of recent things. LRU cache.

### RAM

fastish access, semi-volative.
8 bits \* 4 is 32. So 32 bits of information. Stored in memory 0,1,2,3.
Integer overflow, javascript has floats. As number is too large to store, we store it as Infinity. Any number above a threshold just says Infinity.

### Storage

takes longer to access
non volatile

## Operations on Data Structures

- Insertion (adding apple item in memory)
- Deletion
- Traversal (access each data item once to process)
- Searching (find if it exists in a given collection)
- Sorting
- Access (get data in computer)

## Arrays

if you just need to store and iterate one by one. And you know indices this is the best.
Lookup is O(1). Insert / delete are O(n) linear time.
