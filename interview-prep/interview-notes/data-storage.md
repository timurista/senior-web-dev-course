## Storage

### CPU

fast access, volatile.
Asks RAM what is shelf number 0. It means we can get 0 and immediately access 1071 shelf. Access memory really fast to any shelf at once. Any address at memory. Closer is to computer, faster it runs. CPU tiny memory of recent things. LRU cache.

### RAM

fastish access, semi-volative.
8 bits \* 4 is 32. So 32 bits of information. Stored in memory 0,1,2,3.
Integer overflow, javascript has floats. As number is too large to store, we store it as Infinity. Any number above a threshold just says Infinity.

### Storage

takes longer to access
non volatile
