## Best Coding interview

1. write down points at the top // sroted array, etc. show how organized you are
2. double check what are input what are outputs (confirm what inputs are). Always return true or false. Explain approach. You and interviewer will know steps.
3. What is most important goal? time or space complexity? more than 5 items?
4. Dont be annoying by asking too many questions.
5. start with naive, brute force approach. Talk about first thing. Easy solution. First one in mind. Not most efficient
6. tell them why this approach is not the best. Not readable, hard to read for other developers. (o^2 two for loops)
7. code steps for better solution
8. assume people trying to break code, look for weird ways things could break. Figure out what next
9. write code that reads well, no confusing terms.
10. check code, check things will have issues or problems. Is it readable, what would you google to improve.
11. space complexity...
12. Modularize code from beginning

## 3 pillars

The 3 pillars of good code:

1. Readable
2. Time Complexity
3. Space Complexity
