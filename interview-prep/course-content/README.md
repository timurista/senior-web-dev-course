General notes on coding solutions

## Runtime
you could have linear n runtime, or O(n*n) as exponential time runtime complexity.

Combining time
constant run time.

no matter what input it will take almost exact amount of time.

## Solution
you need to get it in logarithmic or constant time.
Double elements but not.
Searching will always at best take logarithmic time

linear runtime will take 1 unit.

quasi-linear time:
n * log(n)
1 + a little bit, many sorting algorithms run n * logn time.

**handshake problem**
each new person you add, has to now handshake every other person in the room.

exponential time
one of worst case.
want to avoid algorithm that is exponential time.
Usually better time to solve

recognize an algorithm as being inefficient.

## Interview setting
Identify runtime complexity
Experience, look at diff algorithms

runtime complexity constants are dropped out of calculation.

reverse 2 strings in 1 runtime call.
O(n + m)
second argument then it's m

2 collections of data n*m

sorting shortcuts
o(n * logn)
searching a sorted array
O(logn)

## Space complexity
how much memory or ram it needs.
time on time complexity


## Data structures
some optimal runtime complexity for adding, updating or editing data.

optimal runtime complexity for what we want to solve.

you will be asked about putting together a queue from scratch.

## FIFO and Queues
first in, first out principle for queues. array unshift and pop()

class that just adds and removes. Hiding functional setting is to make sure another engineer doesnt use array methods on it.
