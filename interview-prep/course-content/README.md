General notes on coding solutions

## Runtime
you could have linear n runtime, or O(n*n) as exponential time runtime complexity.

Combining time
constant run time.

no matter what input it will take almost exact amount of time.

## Solution
you need to get it in logarithmic or constant time.
Double elements but not.
Searching will always at best take logarithmic time

linear runtime will take 1 unit.

quasi-linear time:
n * log(n)
1 + a little bit, many sorting algorithms run n * logn time.

**handshake problem**
each new person you add, has to now handshake every other person in the room.

exponential time
one of worst case.
want to avoid algorithm that is exponential time.
Usually better time to solve

recognize an algorithm as being inefficient.
