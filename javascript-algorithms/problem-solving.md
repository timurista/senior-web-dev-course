## Objectives

What is an algorithm

compare and contrast problem solving problems.

## What is algorithm?

process or set of steps to accomplish a task.

## How do you improve?

1. devise a plan for solving problems. 
2. Master common problem solving patterns

some recipes to solve challenge

## Problem solving things
steps to help
1. understand the problem
2. explore concrete examples
3. break it down
4. solve/simplify
5. look back and refactor

## Understand the Problem
explore concrete examples
break it down
solve/simplify
look back and refactor

thorough investigation of problem

## Questions to ask

1. can you restate the problem in your own words.
2. Restate problem in your own words
  - what are the inputs?
  - what are the outputs?
  - what should come back

4. can outputs be determined from inputs?
  - do I have enough information to solve the problem
  - worth considering it at an early stage

5. how should I label important pieces of data which are part of the problem?


Example
write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
  1) restate problem: takes 2 numbers only (not strings) with range -infinity to infinity and add them together.
  2) inputs (2 number what's upper bound?)
  3) what are outputs? A float, a number what happens at edge cases?
  4) outputs from inputs?

  5) label important pieces of data
    add, num1, num2
