## Explain algorithms

implement 3 sorts.
But these do not scale well
fast sorts, can improve time complexity to O(n^2) to o(nlogn)

## Merge Sort
combination of splitting up
sorting and merging
array of 0 or 1 elements are sorted already
  - breaks array into smaller arrays
  - then merge and recombine

# Part 1 Merging arrays
