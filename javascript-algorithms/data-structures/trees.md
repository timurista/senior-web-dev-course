## Trees
Implementing operations on binary search tree
data structures that have parent / child node
which can connect to 1, 2 nodes.

a singly linked list is tree
2 -> 12 -> 11
not a tree is references things not below them.
Tree every node moves away from root node. Have to have 1 root or entry point.

root, parent, siblings, leaf is node with no children
connection is edge which connects two nodes, parent and child.

DOM tree structure on the browser. And routing using a tree structure for network routing for shortest path. AST, abstract syntax tree.


Trees are used in classification, for decisions of what move to do next. Folders, etc.
