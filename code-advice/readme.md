## Complex vs Simple
Always choose simplicity over complexity. Try to make things super simple. Never scoff at people making silly questions. Don't choose cool things to be capable. Always choose simplicity over complexity. Good code is self documenting, easy to jump in and learn what is doing. Easy to read.

Make sure it is worth it.

Some people can accomplish more than others. Be efficient. Figure out what works for you. You become better, constantly evolving. Learn best learning style.

## Start with Why
Why are we learning this?
